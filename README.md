# Singapore Weather

## A demo

To explore the capability of Tornado web framework in terms of holding multiple long connections, I have built a simple weather tracking web app which periodically fetches live weather information in Singapore and pushes to all connected clients. Check it out on your mobile device! It may be useful if you happen to travel to Singapore - it rains on and off every day.

## TODOs

- Apply testing (pytest)
- Improve UI for the weather widget (add effects like rain, cloud, wind direction...)
